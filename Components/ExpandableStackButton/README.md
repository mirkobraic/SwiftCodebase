# ExpandableStackButton

A flexible iOS component that provides an expandable stack of buttons with smooth animations. Available in both UIKit and SwiftUI implementations.

The component creates a toggle button that reveals/hides a stack of expandable buttons. Each button in the stack can expand to show multiple action buttons with smooth animations. Perfect for creating compact, interactive UI elements that don't clutter the interface.
